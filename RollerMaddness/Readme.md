# Roller Maddness

This is a simple two-level game which uses standard and customized assets. The objective of the game is to collect a targeted amount of coins, avoiding enemies and death zone.
Most of the scripts were imported or provided. I added a 'Camera Change' script after reading the Unity documentation, which changes the camera from Main Camera to Secondary Camera when Player enters Trigger Zone.
